# About 

This is a refactored version of the first assignment in the course 'Introduction to Javascript'. The application uses local storage to store the users to-do list. You can add new tasks, mark them as done and remove them from the list, or clear the whole list and start over. If, for some reason, you would want to sort your to-do's in alphabetical order, that's also possible :)

# Commit message convention

I'm using the following commit message convention:

#### Format of the commit message:

```txt
(<type>): subject

Example message:
(docs): update README

For the <subject> I will use imperative, present tense (eg: use "add" instead of "added" or "adds")
```

#### <type> values

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
